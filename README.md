* ";" in javascript is "a good practise" but is decreasing in use
* You didnt have a 404 not-found page, or a redirection. I will implement redirection instead of the error you have.
* I wont use Navbar or specially Footer from App because some views dont have it
* Every component have an index.js inside to facility the reusability and usability
* In the index/home you have some inconsistencies in the responsive part... so dont know exactly how do you want it
